# Sequence diagrams

Grouped sequence diagrams matching the backend code structure. Open a group to view individual flows.

## Groups

- [Auth](./auth/README.md)
- [Transactions](./transactions/README.md)
- [Budgets](./budgets/README.md)
- [Categories](./categories/README.md)
- [User](./user/README.md)
- [Subscriptions](./subscriptions/README.md)
- [Reports](./reports/README.md)
- [Statistics](./statistics/README.md)

## Notes

- The files linked from the group READMEs have been moved into their matching subfolders (one `.md` per flow). Group READMEs now use local links to those files.

If you'd like the old top-level copies kept for any reason (e.g., external previews), tell me and I can restore them, otherwise everything is now physically grouped.
